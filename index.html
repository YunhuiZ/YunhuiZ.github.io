                <p> My name is Yunhui. I am a Master of IT student in The University of Western Australia.
                    My career journey began with dreams of being an English Interpreter, jet-setting to meet clients, rediscovering old streets, savoring the moment with local cuisine, and catching interesting arguments from locals' conversations...
                    With a BA in English, it seemed like the perfect fit. I eagerly embraced interpretation and translation quality control roles, even launching my own freelance business. Yet, deep down, I felt an insatiable craving for more—more knowledge, more challenges, something electrifying that would truly ignite my passion.
                    The moment I pressed play on my first Python tutorial video, everything changed. I was on fire. From that moment on, coding became my passion. Web development called to me, blending creativity and problem-solving in a way I'd never experienced before. I revelled in the thrill of breaking code to rebuild it better in a separate Git branch.
                    Piecing together modules to press “Run All” on AI and ML models became my entertainment.  I found immense satisfaction in watching my web pages seamlessly transform for mobile screens while retaining their aesthetic appeal. In many ways, I realized, I was like those web pages—adaptable, yet always preserving my creative essence.
                    My professional path has been an adventure across diverse roles, each adding new facets to my skillset. As a Market Research Analyst at a stealth startup, I delved into the depths of ABS data, artificial intelligence, and market reports, validating startup ideas and defining market sizes. At Practera, I immersed myself in the macadamia industry, crafting strategies to enhance consumer sales and optimize online presence.
                    Joining the Code for Causes Club at the University of Western Australia as a Backend Developer, I collaborated on projects, merging Next.js, Tailwind, React, and Django with test-driven development to create seamless integrations. My time as a Data & Application Intern at South Metropolitan Health Service saw me transitioning dashboards from Tableau to Power BI, creating dynamic data visualization tools and implementing digital health solutions.
                    My expertise lies in swiftly picking up new skills and programming languages, solving complex problems, applying domain-driven design, and optimizing websites. I thrive in environments where I can leverage MVVM and MVC methods to organize code efficiently. With Python, Java, C#, .Net Framework, SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Angular, and Git/GitHub under my belt, I remain eager to embrace any new technologies that cross my path.
